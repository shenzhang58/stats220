# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in BSc.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am interseted in a job about data analysis.
- I am interested in learning about various tools for exploratory data analysis, including using the R and Python programming languages.
